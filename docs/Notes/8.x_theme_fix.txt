Only x translation is a problem.
N_GameRoot scale controls the gameroot scrollwidth, so change x scale of it to like 0.00001 and change N_Game to 100000 to compensate: is doesn't scroll anymore.
RdtBase
    N_ScrollWindow
        width: 100000.0
    N_GameRoot 
        x Translation: p. Keep in mind N_Icon_00 at x=0
        x Scale: 0.00001
    N_Game
    x translation: 0 (!)
        x Scale: 100000.0
        N_Icon_xx
            x Translation: set the N_Icon_00 to x=0 and start from there. Keep in mind the scale of the RootPane in RdtBtnIconGame
        N_Icon_12
            L_BtnFlc
                x/y scale: same as RdtBtnIconGame
    Move the icons you want to hide to (1;9999). 
    Don't forget to change y and scale of other things like scrollwindow/area y translation as usual
Then to change size of the icons:
RdtBtnIconGame
    RootPane   
        x Scale: p
        y Scale: p
    B_Hit
        width/height: devide default by RootPane scale (Controls the 'cursor snap area'. Must be the right size to prevent the cursor from skipping an icon)
        x+y Scale: set it to the opposite of the width/height change (eg. width 264->132: scale 1->2) (controls the touch area)
       
RdtBtnFullLauncher
    ?Don't think you have to change anything here
